# Résumé Generator

A .Net Core project that allows you to generate a simple résumé without needing to pay for a subscription. 

## About

This is extensibly a project for my [personal website](https://ianknighton.com), so most of the documentation will live there. As posts come out, I will update the Table of Contents.

Any information necessary for building and working with the project will be included here as it comes up. 

## Table of Contents

* [The Setup](https://ianknighton.com/building-a-resume-generator-the-setup)
* [The Foundation](https://ianknighton.com/building-a-resume-generator-the-foundation)

## Setup

As of the most recent update, there's a whole lot of nothing here. 

You can clone the repository and use `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` to run the project, but as of this update you'll just receive a basic `Hello World` page. 

Keep following a long for better things (*I hope*).
